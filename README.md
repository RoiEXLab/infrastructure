# Infrastructure


- cron does an update of the deployed infrastructure code by removing the infrastructure folder and creating a 
  new clone.
  

***TODO***: be sure to update cron job schedule on each iteration 
if we can so we can change it

***TODO***: good checks that secret file is present


## First time setup

```
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanVanAtta/infrastructure/master/setup/first_time_setup.sh")
```

Wait for cronjob to kick in, then run `./infrastructure/setupset_host_name.sh <hostName>`



Verify setup:
* should notice an 'infrastructure' folder: `ls /root/`
* `crontab -l` should have a cron installed

Then set hostname:
```
/root/infrastructure/set_host_name.sh {hostname}
```
Verify:
* `/etc/hostname` should contain the new name
* `/etc/hosts` file should look like this:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost BotServer_NJ_70
```


## Generate SSH key:
```
 ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -C [user]@[machine]
 eg: ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -C joe@alien-laptop
```

## Test and Manual Trigger
SSH to the machine and run the cron by hand:
```
/root/infrastructure/update_cron.sh
```


## Component (Role) List

- Lobby server
- Lobby database
- Bot server
- Dice server

## Setup & Configuration

After we create a linode server and give it a hostname and cron, we can then manage it by adding an entry
to the infrastructure control file: `system_control.sh`.


## Infrastructure Control File

- Single file that drives infrastructure configuration, maps hostnames to their update instructions
- script will do core setup and install if not yet done
- script will finish by executing 'role' specific install or update; this is done by matching
hostname with a switch statement, the switch statement will have the appropriate update command
configured with parameters.


## Gitter integration

Hosts will send their activity messages to a gitter chat, by watching this we can see message like:

```
bot_california_01 is starting initial install
bot_california_01 is starting initial install
